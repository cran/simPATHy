# Data preparation
We consider the acute lymphocytic leukemia dataset, included with the **simPATHy** package,  first published in [@chiaretti2005gene]. This dataset contains expression of 3405 genes in two conditions with  sample sizes $n_1=37$ and $n_2=41$.


```{r,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
library(simPATHy)
library(graph)
```
```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(simPATHy)
library(graph)
```
```{r}
data("chimera")
dim(chimera)
table(colnames(chimera))
```

The column names indicate the condition (1 or 2) of each sample. 

We take a subset of genes corresponding to  the genes participating in the KEGG's  [``Acute Myeloid Leukemia'' pathway](http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05221).

Next, a directed acyclic graph is derived manually from this pathway. 
```{r}
graph<-gRbase::dag(~867:25+867:613+5295:867+5294:867+
207:5295+207:5294+4193:207+3551:207+
4792:3551+7157:4193+3265:6654+
3845:6654+6654:2885+2885:25+2885:613)
```

We  take the first condition of this dataset as a reference condition for our example and begin by estimating  the covariance matrix.

```{r}
genes<-graph::nodes(graph)
data<-t(chimera[genes,colnames(chimera)==1])
S<-cov(data) 
```

The  matrix `S` does not reflect conditional independence constraints imposed by the `graph`. To impose these structural constraints **simPATHy** provides a function `fitSgraph` for maximum likelihood estimation of covariance matrices in graphical models, for both Gaussian bayesian networks and Gaussian graphical models.

```{r}
S<-fitSgraph(graph,S)
round(S[1:5,1:5],3)
```

The package  also provides two plotting functions for  graphical models. The first `plotGraphNELD3`, focuses on the graphical structure, while the second one, `plotCorGraph`, focuses on the  correlation matrix. In both cases, the colors represent the strength of relation between nodes, where the user by setting the parameter `type` chooses whether to show the pairwise correlation coefficient (`type= "cor"`) or the partial correlation coefficient (`type= "pcor"`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plotGraphNELD3(graph,type = "cor",S1 = S)
```

You can play with the interactive version by executing the above comand." onload="$(this).tooltip()">
</center>

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7,  fig.align='center'}
plotCorGraph(S1 = S,type = "cor")
```

When the number of nodes is high and relations between them week, a user can  improve the visibility by adjusting the color range `colLim` (uncomment to launch).

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7,  fig.align='center'}
lim<-round(max(abs(simPATHy:::riscala(S))[upper.tri(S)]),2)
#plotGraphNELD3(graph,type = "cor",S1 = S,colLim = c(-lim,lim))
plotCorGraph(S1 = S,type ="cor",colLim = c(-lim,lim))
```

Note that when an element  is outside of the `colLim`  interval,  it is colored gray in `plotCorGraph` and  represented as a dashed link in  `plotGraphNELD3`.

When plotting a correlation matrix, a user can also pass the associated graph to the `plotCorGraph` function to plot the adjacency matrix  over the correlation (or partial correlation) matrix.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7,  fig.align='center'}
plotCorGraph(S1 = S,type = "cor", graph = graph)
```

The zero elements of the adjacency matrix are represented as shaded squares, whereas non-zero elements are represented as squares with grey borderline. 

# Selecting a path in a graph
Now that we have defined a graph and obtained a covariance matrix for the reference condition, we select a path that is to be dysregulated in the dysregulated condition. 
For **simPATHy** a path is defined as a list of edges od the graph. It can be set manually

```{r }
path <- list(c("613","1398"),c("25","1398"),c("1398","5295"),
 c("5295","207"),c("207","4193"),c("4193","7157"))
```

Alternatively, **simPATHy** provides a `generatePATH` function that finds the shortest path connecting  two given  nodes.

```{r }
path <- generatePath(graph,from="613",to="7157")
```

Finally, a user can select a path in an interactive plot by calling the function `getPathShiny`. The desired path is chosen edge by edge, and upon completion a user  presses \texttt{Get path} button.  

```{r, eval=FALSE }
path <- getPathShiny(graph)
```

<img src="images/getPathShiny.png" style="height:400px" alt="getPathShiny" data-placement="center" title="" data-original-title="Note that this is just an image of the visualization so it's not interactive. You can play with the interactive version by executing the above comand." onload="$(this).tooltip()">

# Selecting parameters of dysregulation
By dysregulation we intend some multiplicative  change of a subset of a correlation matrix. To specify the strength of dysregulation a user provides  two positive parameters `min` and `max`. The strength of dysregulation  is then sampled uniformly from the interval `[min, max]`: a value smaller than 1 represents deactivation (a relation between two variables  is weakened), a value greater than 1 represents activation (a relation between two variables is strengthened).  These parameters are specified for each  path edge separately. 
```{r}
min<-c(2,8,2,0.1,0.5)
max<-c(2,10,2,4,0.5)
```

In some applications it might be of interest to  change the direction of relation between two variables (the correlation coefficient changes sign). To allow for this possibility, `simPATHy` provides  `prob` parameter. `prob` is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 implying that the sign of the correlation coefficient  should be changed, and 1  implying that the sign should be left unaltered (default setting). Values between the two extremes allow for random sign switch: the sign is changed with probability `1-prob`. 

```{r}
prob<-c(1,0,0,0.5,1)
dys<-cbind(min,max,prob)
rownames(dys)<-sapply(path,paste,collapse = "~")
dys
```

For example, the correlation coefficient between variables `613` and `867` is to be  activated in the dysregulated condition, more precisely, multiplied by two, while  the relation between `4193` and `7157` is to be deactivated in the second condition (the correlation coefficient  multiplied by 0.5).  On the other hand, the nature of  relation between `5295` and `207` is to be changed in the dysregulated condition (switch), since `prob=0` implies sign change.  

# Results
After choosing the sample sizes `n1` and `n2` for the two conditions  (default is 500), we
 have  set all the required parameters and can proceed  by calling the main function `simPATHy`. 
 
```{r}
set.seed(123)
Result<-simPATHy(graph,path,S,min,max,prob)
```

The output is a `simPATHy` class object represented by a list of nine elements.

```{r}
class(Result)
names(Result)
```

The key element is the simulated `dataset` containing  `n1+n2` observations from two conditions--reference condition `cl1` and dysregulated condition `cl2`--sampled from  multivariate normal distributions with covariance matrices `Result$S1`  and `Result$S2`, respectively. 

```{r}
round(Result$dataset[c(1:3,501:503),1:5],3)
```

By default observations are sampled from zero mean normal distributions; however,  a user can specify different values for `mu1` and `mu2`.

We can also recover the dysregulation parameters.

```{r}
Result$param
```

Sometimes the dysregulation specified by the above parameters is not admissible since the modified correlation coefficient lies outside the (-1,1) range. Furthermore, to avoid excessively  strong  dysregulations,  the upper limit for the absolute value of the dysregulated correlation coefficient is set to $$\min(0.9; 1.25\max \left\{|\rho_{u,v}|, u\neq v\right\}),$$ where $R=(\rho_{u,v})$ is the correlation matrix of the reference condition.  For this reason, simPATHy also returns the actual multiplicative constant applied to each path edge correlation coefficient.
```{r}
Result$strength
```

When the dysregulation of the initial (reference condition) covariance matrix leads to a matrix that is no longer positive definite, the resulting matrix is corrected via internal function  `makePositiveDefinite`. Whether the correction has been performed and if yes,  what is the constant added to the diagonal is also reported.
```{r}
Result$correction
```

The summary of the output is provided by the function `easyLookDys`.
```{r eval = FALSE}
easyLookDys(Result)
```

```{r echo= FALSE}
knitr::kable(easyLookDys(Result))
```

To visualize differences in two conditions we can use plotting functions mentioned previously: `plotGraphNELD3` and `plotCorGraph`. In this case, both functions take, in addition to the graph, two covariance matrices corresponding to two conditions and  plot  the difference between them (uncomment to launch).
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7,  fig.align='center'}
#plotGraphNELD3(graph,type = "cor",S1 = Result$S1, S2 = Result$S2, colLim = c(-0.4,0.4))
plotCorGraph(S1 = Result$S1, S2 = Result$S2, type = "cor",
graph = graph, path = Result$path,colLim = c(-0.4,0.4))
```

A user can examine  these plots in more detail by calling an interactive  `easyLookShiny` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
easyLookShiny(Result, graph)
```
